# n8n Astronomy Workflows

Notes and resources from n8n talk @ Christchurch AI Meetup. These workflows serve as practical demonstrations of n8n's automation capabilities, modern AI integration patterns, and real-world data processing scenarios. They provide some example workflows that show the integration of n8n, Slack, and Pinecone, in the context of extracting and using information from the [Phys.org](https://phys.org/) website. In addition to this, a simple webform workflow is provided as an introductory example, and a chatbot app in Slack to show a basic LLM workflow.

## About These Demonstration Workflows

The demonstration workflows were built around n8n and Slack, with the addition of Pinecone as a vector database. As there are a large number of integrations available in n8n, I chose Slack - a familiar platform - to demonstrate some of the key automation concepts and capabilities.

Pinecone was included to demonstrate how vector stores work and how to use them as part of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, showcasing modern AI-powered workflow capabilities.

Because I am passionate about astronomy and astrophysics, I built the demonstration workflows around extracting and using data from the [Phys.org](https://phys.org/) website, creating practical examples that combine my interests with real-world automation scenarios.

## How to Import Workflows into n8n

To use these workflows in your n8n instance, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new workflow** - In your n8n dashboard, click "Create Workflow"

2. **Copy the JSON file** - Click on any workflow JSON file link below (e.g., [`ask-an-astronomer-slack-channel-chatbot.json`](./ask-an-astronomer-slack-channel-chatbot.json))

3. **Get the raw content** - On the GitHub file page, click the "Copy raw file" button (ðŸ“‹ icon) located just to the right of the "Raw" button

4. **Paste into n8n** - Go back to your new n8n workflow, click on the blank canvas, and paste:
   - **Windows**: Ctrl+V
   - **Mac**: Command+V (âŒ˜+V)
   - **Linux**: Ctrl+V

The workflow will automatically populate with all nodes and connections from the JSON file.

5. **Configure credentials** - You will need to create your own credentials in n8n for:
   - **Slack** - For Slack integrations and bot functionality
   - **OpenAI** - For AI chat models and embeddings
   - **Pinecone** - For vector database operations

   If you use the same credential names as already referenced in the workflow nodes, they should automatically populate (though this isn't guaranteed). Otherwise, you'll need to manually assign your credentials to each relevant node.

## Technical Stack

- **n8n**: Workflow automation platform
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 models and embeddings
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for article storage
- **Slack**: Team communication and notifications
- **Phys.org**: RSS feed source for astronomy articles

## Setup Requirements

1. n8n instance with required node packages
2. OpenAI API credentials
3. Pinecone vector database setup
4. Slack workspace and bot tokens
5. Webhook configurations for triggers

## Configuration Notes

### Important Customizations Required

**Slack Setup**: 
- Create the following channels in your Slack workspace:
  - `#ask-an-astronomer` (for the chatbot workflow)
  - `#contact-form` (for web contact form notifications)
  - `#n8n-test` (for article ingestion notifications)
  - `#all-astrotope-dev` (for RSS feed summaries)
- Configure channel IDs in each workflow's Slack nodes
- Set up Slack credentials and bot permissions

**n8n Documentation**:
- [Slack Trigger Node Setup](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/)
- [Slack Credentials Configuration](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/)
- [Form Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/) - Creates web-based forms with customizable fields, supports basic authentication, provides separate test and production URLs, and can be configured with custom form paths, titles, and descriptions. Forms can be embedded in websites or used as standalone hosted pages.
- [Chat Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) - Creates public chat interfaces for AI agent interactions, enables dynamic chat generation for workflow automation and user interaction. Chat interfaces can be embedded in websites or accessed as standalone hosted pages.

**Pinecone Vector Store**: 
- Create a new index named `astro-articles`
- Use OpenAI "text-embedding-3-small" model with dimension 1536
- Leave all other settings unchanged
- The RAG chat workflow depends on the ingestion workflow - run ingestion first to populate the vector store

**OpenAI Models Used**:
- Ask an Astronomer: GPT-4.1-mini
- RAG Agent Chat: GPT-4o-mini
- All workflows: OpenAI embeddings with 1536 dimensions

### Workflow Dependencies

1. **Run ingestion workflow first**: The "Ingest Astronomy Articles" workflow must be executed before the "RAG Agent-Assisted Chat" workflow will function properly
2. **Vector store population**: The chat agent relies on articles being stored in the Pinecone vector database
3. **Daily scheduling**: The RSS summary workflow runs daily at 11:38 AM - adjust timing as needed

### Technical Details

- **Article filtering**: Ingestion workflow filters for articles from last 7 days in categories: Astronomy, Space Exploration, Planetary Sciences, Astrobiology
- **Batch processing**: Article downloads are processed one at a time to avoid rate limiting
- **Public webhooks**: Contact form and RAG chat have public-facing webhook URLs
- **Bot exclusions**: Slack chatbot ignores messages from SLACKBOT and the app bot to prevent recursion

### Data Sources

**Phys.org RSS Feeds**:
- Main RSS feeds page: [https://phys.org/feeds/](https://phys.org/feeds/)
- Space news RSS feed used by workflows: [https://phys.org/rss-feed/space-news/](https://phys.org/rss-feed/space-news/)
- Example article format: [Webb fresh take on a classic deep field](https://phys.org/news/2025-08-image-webb-fresh-classic-deep.html)
- Sample RSS feed data: `phys-org-space-news-example-feed.rss` (included in repository)

## Slack Integration Setup

### 1. Slack App Strategy

**Recommended Approach: Single App**
- Use one Slack app for all workflows for simplicity
- Easier credential management in n8n
- Streamlined setup and maintenance

**Advanced Approach: Separate Apps**
- Create individual apps for each workflow type
- **Benefits**: Minimal permissions per app, better security isolation, easier permission auditing
- **Trade-offs**: More complex setup, multiple credential sets to manage
- Consider for production environments with strict security requirements

### 2. Create Your Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App" â†’ "From scratch"
3. Enter app name (e.g., "Astronomy Workflows") and select your workspace
4. Click "Create App"

### 3. Configure OAuth Scopes

Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** in your Slack app settings.

**Essential Bot Token Scopes** (required for all workflows + n8n GUI):
- `chat:write` - Send messages to channels
- `channels:read` - List and view basic channel information (enables n8n GUI channel selection)
- `channels:history` - View messages in channels (required for chatbot workflow and n8n event listening)
- `users:read` - View user information (enables n8n GUI to show usernames/IDs)

**Additional Bot Token Scopes** (if using advanced features):
- `im:read` - View direct message info (may be needed for n8n GUI functionality)
- `files:read` - If workflows need to access shared files

**User Token Scopes** (only if needed for advanced workspace management):
- Generally not required for these astronomy workflows
- Consider only if you need elevated workspace permissions

### 4. Event Subscriptions (Required for Chatbot Workflow)

1. Go to **Event Subscriptions** in your Slack app settings
2. Turn on "Enable Events"
3. **Get Request URL from n8n**:
   - Open your chatbot workflow in n8n
   - Click on the "Slack Chat Trigger" node
   - Copy the webhook URL (format: `https://[your-instance].app.n8n.cloud/webhook/[webhook-id]/webhook`)
4. Paste the webhook URL into the "Request URL" field
5. Slack will verify the URL (n8n handles this automatically)
6. Subscribe to **Bot Events**:
   - `message.channels` - Listen for messages in public channels

### 5. Install App and Get Tokens

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Click "Install to Workspace"
3. Review permissions and click "Allow"
4. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)
5. If you configured User Token Scopes, also copy the **User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxp-`)

### 6. Set Up n8n Credentials

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** â†’ **Credentials**
2. Click "Create Credential" â†’ "Slack OAuth2 API"
3. Enter your **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`)
4. Optionally enter **User OAuth Token** if you have one
5. Test the connection
6. Save the credential with a descriptive name

**Verification**: Once credentials are saved, n8n should be able to:
- List your Slack channels by name in workflow nodes
- Show user IDs and usernames in relevant fields
- Access channel information for configuration

### 7. Configure Workflows

**Channel Setup**:
1. Create these channels in your Slack workspace:
   - `#ask-an-astronomer` - For the AI chatbot
   - `#contact-form` - For contact form notifications  
   - `#n8n-test` - For article ingestion notifications
   - `#all-astrotope-dev` - For RSS feed summaries

2. **Invite your bot to channels**:
   - Type `/invite @YourBotName` in each channel
   - Or use channel settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Add apps

**n8n Workflow Configuration**:
- Import the workflow JSON files into n8n
- Update Slack credential references to use your new credential
- Select appropriate channels using the n8n GUI dropdowns (no manual ID editing needed)
- Test each workflow individually

### 8. Webhook URL Management

**Getting Webhook URLs**:
- Each trigger node in n8n generates its own webhook URL
- URLs follow pattern: `https://[instance].app.n8n.cloud/webhook/[unique-id]/webhook`
- **Production vs Test**: n8n provides different URLs for test and production modes

**Using Webhook URLs**:
- **Slack Trigger**: Copy URL to Slack app Event Subscriptions
- **Form Trigger**: Use URL for website integration or standalone form
- **Chat Trigger**: Use URL for public chat interface

### 9. Security Considerations

**Single App Benefits**:
- Simplified management and setup
- One set of credentials to maintain
- Good for development and small teams

**Separate Apps Benefits** (Advanced):
- **Chatbot App**: Only needs `channels:history`, `chat:write`, `users:read`
- **Notification App**: Only needs `chat:write`, `channels:read`
- **Form App**: Only needs `chat:write` for notifications
- Better security isolation and permission auditing

### 10. Troubleshooting

**n8n GUI Issues**:
- **Can't see channels**: Check `channels:read` scope is granted
- **Can't see users**: Check `users:read` scope is granted
- **Events not working**: Verify webhook URL and `channels:history` scope

**Webhook Problems**:
- **Verification failed**: Ensure n8n workflow is active and webhook URL is correct
- **Events not received**: Check bot is invited to relevant channels
- **Wrong URL format**: Verify you're using the full webhook URL from n8n

**Permission Errors**:
- **Bot not in channel**: Use `/invite @BotName` in the channel
- **Insufficient scopes**: Review and add missing OAuth scopes
- **Token expired**: Regenerate tokens in Slack app settings

**Message Formatting Issues**:
- Test Block Kit JSON using [Slack's Block Kit Builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder)
- Verify proper escaping of special characters in message content
