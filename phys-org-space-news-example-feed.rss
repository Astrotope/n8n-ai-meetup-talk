                <title>Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy could enable future satellite swarms to complete science goals with little human help</title>
                <description>Astronauts living and working on the moon and Mars will rely on satellites to provide services like navigation, weather, and communications relays. While managing complex missions, automating satellite communications will allow explorers to focus on critical tasks instead of manually operating satellites.</description>

                <description>Astronauts exploring the moon will need all the help they can get, and scientists have spent lots of time and plenty of money coming up with different systems to do so. Two of the critical needs of any long-term lunar mission are food and oxygen, both of which are expensive to ship to the moon from Earth.</description>

                <title>Deep view of Abell 3667 illuminates the past of a galaxy cluster and the future of astronomical imaging</title>
                <description>Galaxy clusters are among the largest structures in our universe, consisting of hundreds or thousands of galaxies that have become gravitationally bound together over billions of years. Astrophysicists have long been eager to understand the formation of these imposing structures. The histories of galaxy clusters not only help us understand how the universe formed, but they also provide constraints on the properties of dark matter—an invisible material that doesn&#039;t emit or reflect light and is found in high concentrations around clusters of galaxies.</description>

                <description>We usually think of satellites as small objects orbiting planets or stars. But in the broader universe, galaxies themselves can have satellites—smaller galaxies bound by gravity that orbit a larger host, carrying with them stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.</description>

                <description>Astronomers have discovered a vast and expanding bubble of gas and dust surrounding a red supergiant star—the largest structure of its kind ever seen in the Milky Way. The bubble, which contains as much mass as the sun, was blown out in a mysterious stellar eruption about 4,000 years ago. Why the star survived such a powerful event is a puzzle, scientists say.</description>

                <description>Astronomers have observed an explosion in space that is pushing back against and influencing the baby star which triggered the explosion in the first place. If explosions like this one are common around young stars, then the young stars and their planets are exposed to a harsher environment than previously thought.</description>

                <description>Thirteen years after Curiosity landed on Mars, engineers are finding ways to make the NASA rover even more productive. The six-wheeled robot has been given more autonomy and the ability to multitask—improvements designed to make the most of Curiosity&#039;s energy source, a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG). Increased efficiency means the rover has ample power as it continues to decipher how the ancient Martian climate changed, transforming a world of lakes and rivers into the chilly desert it is today.</description>

                <description>If you want to get to the moon, you need to spend an enormous amount of resources developing, creating, testing, and deploying a variety of spacecraft and technologies. All you need is money. Lots of money. For decades, the only entities with enough green in checking accounts were large governments or multi-national consortia. But nowadays we have some absurdly wealthy, and absurdly motivated, individuals who have stars in their eyes and designs on space missions of their own.</description>

                <description>I don&#039;t think space or lunar tourism is going to be the big draw that transforms the moon into something unrecognizable. Instead, I think it&#039;s going to be more about large-scale mining and industrialization that scars the lunar surface. So when it comes to possible industrial hellscapes that the moon might turn into, think less Las Vegas and more… Gary, Indiana. No offense, Gary, but you&#039;re kind of an industrial hellscape.</description>

                <title>NASA&#039;s Europa clipper radar instrument proves itself at Mars</title>
                <description>As it soared past Mars in March, NASA&#039;s Europa Clipper conducted a critical radar test that had been impossible to accomplish on Earth. Now that mission scientists have studied the full stream of data, they can declare success: The radar performed just as expected, bouncing and receiving signals off the region around Mars&#039; equator without a hitch.</description>

                <title>The global race to space isn&#039;t just about big countries</title>
                <description>The United States and China aren&#039;t the only powerful, wealthy nations in the world, and they&#039;re certainly not the only nations active in space. For example, there are the Russians, who are…kind of distracted at the moment, so for our purposes there really isn&#039;t much to talk about there.</description>

                <description>Astronomers from Wuhan University in China have employed the Insight-HXMT satellite to observe a giant outburst that occurred in the X-ray binary RX J0440.9+4431 about three years ago. Results of the observations, presented July 24 on the pre-print server arXiv, provide a wealth of data regarding the properties and behavior of this system.</description>

                <description>Since 2017, three interstellar objects have been spotted passing through our solar system: 1I/ʻOumuamua, 2I/Borisov… and just this month, 3I/ATLAS. Discovered on July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert Survey, 3I/ATLAS is zipping through the inner solar system in the last half of 2025.</description>
